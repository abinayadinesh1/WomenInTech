                 <p>There are <STRONG>SOOO</STRONG> many people and mentors out there just waiting for someone to come along for them to help! After going to an all-girls STEM event at the Spotify venue in NY, I had the pleasure to meet lots of different women who each went through their own struggles to get where they are today.

        Q. What is the biggest issue for women in tech? <br>
                <br>Monica (graduate from NYU): "You need to have tough skin." As a women in tech, there will always be people second-guessing you and underestimating your abilities. They might not believe that you can do anything of use and make you feel small. But in order to suceed, you really need to have "tough skin" and be able to endure whatever they throw at you. <br>
                
                <br>Arielle (part of development community in Spotify): "We don't get anything for free...you have to prove yourself all the time." In the tech world, some people (mostly men) can just look the part and people automatically think they are smart and valuable. When you are a women in tech, nobody ever thinks that about you. Unless you take the extra step and are constantly proving your worth, other people will just second-guess and underestimate your value. <br>
                
                <br>Akilah (Graduate from Berkeley, works at Google): "Be open minded to other people's experiences." You can always keep learning from people and you should always be open-minded to new information. Don't just think that because you are good at one topic, you should just stick to that topic. There are always more things that you can learn and <I>should</I> if you have the chance.<br>
                
                <br>Sophie (intern at Google):"You're always going to be some <i>only</i> in the room." You might be the only girl, or the only colored person, or the youngest, but sometimes you have to learn how to embrace it an move on.<br>
                
                <br>Tina (Buzzfeed intern): "Proving through proformance." With this quote, Tina proceeded to explain how a colleague had second-guessed her and the best course of action is to show them that you know what you are doing. <br>
                
               <br>(Overall Advice)<br>
                <br>Monica: "Know your contraints, be practical about what you can do."<br>
                "You need to have tough skin."<br>
                "Try something new."<br>
               
                <br>Arielle: "Ability to communicate"   <br>               

                "Flexibility and desire to learn new things"  <br>
                "We don't get anything for free...you have to prove yourself all the time"  <br>
                "Embrace the fact that things won't always go to plan"  <br>
                "Take the time to find balance in your life"<br>
                
                <br>Akilah: "Resiliance"  <br>
                "Perserverance"  <br>
                "Be open minded to other people's experiences"  <br>
                "Internships aren't the only way to move forward"<br>
            
             <br>Sophie: "Find the right role models and mentors for you, and keep a strong connection with them, because you never know how valuable one email can be"  <br>  
                "Ask questions, surround yourself with people who will be there for you"  <br>
                "You are always going to be the only <i>something</i>. Whether its the only girl, mentor, student, or colored person, you will always be unique in some way"
                "Be each other's support network"<br>
                
                <br>Tina: "Be brave and not perfect"  <br>
                "Never stop learning"  <br>
                "Proving through performance"  <br>
                "When one door opens, pull another woman with you. Its always nice to have support and a friend to talk to when you need it"<br>
                
                <br> Martine: "Follow your passions"  <br>
                "Be your authentic self"  <br>
                "To become a better leader in tech is to know your strenghts"
                "Stand your ground"  <br>
                "You belong there, don't let anyone make you feel like you don't"  <br>
                "Be bold"  <br>
                "Never be afraid to speak our mind"  <br>
                "You're in the room for a reason"<br>
